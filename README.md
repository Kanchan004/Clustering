# Clustering
## Libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn are imported.
## Dataset is loaded(iris).
## Then the column 'species' is selected and standardization is done using scaler.
## Elbow method is used which tells how close data points are to the cluster center.
## It provides the number of cluster.
## K-means algorithm is used.
## To do the 2D plotting PCA is done and the image is plotted.
